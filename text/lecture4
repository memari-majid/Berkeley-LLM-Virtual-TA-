The speaker, Burak Gokturk, begins by outlining the focus of the session, which is on trends in AI, particularly what is happening in the market today. He mentions that this session is not about delving deep into algorithms, although some key technical points will be covered, especially concerning the three building blocks for creating agents.

The discussion starts with a brief history of AI, where neural networks were once underappreciated compared to algorithms like support vector machines and decision trees. Gokturk explains that two factors significantly improved the performance of neural networks: their architectural flexibility and the availability of large datasets. He recalls his own experience in cancer detection, working with small datasets that took a long time to process. Now, with large models, training can take weeks or months, and he expresses concern that researchers are losing the ability to gain fast intuition about the impact of their changes to models.

The speaker also touches on the impact of large datasets, explaining how techniques like masking (where words in sentences are hidden and predicted) have allowed the training of large models using vast amounts of data from the web or books. He notes that hardware improvements in GPUs and TPUs, along with the advent of transformers, have played a crucial role in enhancing the performance of neural networks.

Gokturk describes how the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022 was a pivotal moment for AI, particularly for enterprises. This public release changed the mindset around AI's capabilities, leading to a surge of interest from companies. He highlights the rapid advancements in AI, such as image and speech recognition, and emphasizes the role of generative AI, which has reversed the process of input-output models, allowing AI to generate text, images, speech, and videos.

He shows the progress in image classification, where accuracy has increased from about 50% in 2011 to over 90% in recent years. He remarks on how the pace of AI advancements has exceeded expectations, moving faster than what experts predicted 15 years ago. He also shares insights into speech recognition improvements, noting a dramatic reduction in error rates between 2016 and 2021.

Moving to trends in enterprises, Gokturk explains that AI adoption has grown rapidly. Whereas it used to be challenging to find customers for pilot AI products, now enterprises are eager to adopt AI solutions. He attributes this to the reduced need for large, clean datasets, as modern AI models are already trained on vast amounts of data. Enterprises can now use base models and fine-tune them with smaller, more specific datasets, significantly expediting development cycles.

He also discusses how the barrier to AI development has lowered. In the past, only AI experts or data scientists could develop AI applications, but now even middle and high school students can build AI models using large language models. This democratization of AI is leading to an exponential increase in AI-driven applications.

Gokturk then addresses technical trends, noting that the improvement in base models has been so rapid that domain-specific models are often outperformed by new general models. He also discusses the move toward sparse models, which allow for more efficient computation by using fewer nodes in a transformer, reducing latency and costs.

He continues by discussing how models are becoming multimodal, capable of understanding and generating across different modalities, such as text, images, audio, and video. He notes that enterprises are moving away from focusing solely on model size and are now more concerned with flexibility and the ability to try different models on various platforms. Enterprises are increasingly prioritizing platforms that offer multiple models, customization options, and tools to manage models at scale.

Gokturk then covers fine-tuning and distillation, which allow models to be tailored to specific tasks or use cases, often resulting in smaller, more efficient models. He mentions LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation), a common technique for fine-tuning large language models, which is storage-efficient and appealing for enterprises concerned about privacy and security.

Next, Gokturk highlights the importance of grounding in AI models, which involves improving factual accuracy by integrating search capabilities and external data sources. He explains that large language models, while good at reasoning, often hallucinate or provide outdated information. Grounding helps mitigate this by retrieving and verifying information from up-to-date sources, making models more factual and trustworthy.

The discussion moves to function calling, where large language models can call specific functions to perform real-world tasks, such as booking a flight or retrieving a bill. This ability extends the usefulness of language models beyond information retrieval, allowing them to take actions in real-world applications. He stresses the importance of having a good library of functions and training models to know when and how to call the right function.

Gokturk concludes by touching on several tools necessary for building successful AI agents, including prompt management, evaluation tools, and function libraries. He emphasizes the growing trend of using AI models themselves to rate and evaluate other AI models, a task traditionally performed by humans.

Finally, Gokturk offers advice to students, encouraging them to study AI while also incorporating creativity and other disciplines, as the future of programming will require a blend of technical skills and creative thinking. He reiterates the rapid growth of AI, particularly in enterprises, and advises students to stay involved with AI to capitalize on this transformative period in technology.
